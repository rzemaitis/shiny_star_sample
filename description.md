Extragalactic Archaeology using resolved stellar populations
=======================

Extragalactic Archaeology is the study of old (9-13 billion years) structures of galaxies beyond our Milky Way. Currently, the best method to observe such structures is through **resolved stellar populations**. The best stellar candidates for this are old **Red Giant Branch** (RGB) stars, as they are luminous and numerous.

The best way to separate RGB stars from the rest is through a **Colour-Magnitude diagram**. The stars have different colours (surface temperatures) represented by **(g-i)<sub>0</sub>** and magnitudes (brightnesses) represented by **i<sub>0</sub>**. In the plot shown on the left, most old RGB stars are located in the orange polygon shown in the plot.

By selecting a region containing the old RGB stars, the **star map** shows the extended outer regions of galaxies, known as the **stellar halos**. They hold a fossil record of previous collisions and mergers of galaxies. They also unveil evidence of **tidal stripping**, as seen in the case for **F8D1**.
